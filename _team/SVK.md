<h2>ShortBio</h2>
Sami Koho studied Information Technology in Tampere University of Technology, with dual Majors in Medical Electronics and Embedded Systems, and a minor in Industrial Management. He graduated in 2009, after which he embarked on an academic career. He held different teaching staff positions at University of Turku from 2009 to 2019. In spring 2011, he also decided to do a PhD in super-resolution optical microscopy; the Laboratory of Biophysics, lead by Prof. Pekka Hänninen has a long history in microcopy research. The subject of his thesis, completed in 2016 is *“Bioimage informatics in STED super-resolution microscopy”*. Since 2017 Sami has been with the Molecular Microscopy and Spectorscopy lab at IIT, first as a Post-doctoral researcher and currently as a Marie Curie EF-IF research fellow. His research interests include the design of super-resolution optical microscopy methods, bioimage informatics (image reconstruction, restoration, analysis) and adaptive optics.


<h2>Projects Description</h2>

**AdaptiveSTED**: With high-resolution optical microscopes it is possible to take highly accurate pictures of the life taking place within cells. The problem however is that cells, especially in their natural environment — within a tissue — are not very transparent and thus not easy to image. Aberration correction has been found to improve the performance of optical microscopes in complex samples. The problem is that the state-of-the-art aberration correction techniques are themselves complex, and thus not suitable for non-expert users. In the AdaptiveSTED project we aim to develop a new aberration correction scheme, which ideally would be so simple to use and automatic that users, when taking pictures with a microscope, would not even need to know of its existence.
