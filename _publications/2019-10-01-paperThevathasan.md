<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Quantitative fluorescence and superresolution microscopy are often limited by insufficient data quality or artifacts. In this
context, it is essential to have biologically relevant control samples to benchmark and optimize the quality of microscopes,
labels and imaging conditions. Here, we exploit the stereotypic arrangement of proteins in the nuclear pore complex as in situ
reference structures to characterize the performance of a variety of microscopy modalities. We created four genome edited
cell lines in which we endogenously labeled the nucleoporin Nup96 with mEGFP, SNAP-tag, HaloTag or the photoconvertible
fluorescent protein mMaple. We demonstrate their use (1) as three-dimensional resolution standards for calibration and quality control, (2) to quantify absolute labeling efficiencies and (3) as precise reference standards for molecular counting. These
cell lines will enable the broader community to assess the quality of their microscopes and labels, and to perform quantitative,
absolute measurements.
