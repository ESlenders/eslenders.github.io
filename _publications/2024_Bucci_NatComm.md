<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Single-particle tracking techniques enable investigation of the complex functions and interactions of individual particles in biological environments. Many such techniques exist, each demonstrating trade-offs between spatiotemporal resolution, spatial and temporal range, technical complexity, and information content. To mitigate these trade-offs, we enhanced a confocal laser scanning microscope with an asynchronous read-out single-photon avalanche diode array detector. This detector provides an image of the particle’semission, precisely reflecting its position within the excitation volume. This localization is utilized in a real-time feedback system to drive the microscope scanning mechanism and ensure the particle remains centered inside the excitation volume. As each pixel is an independent single-photon detector, singleparticle tracking is combined with fluorescence lifetime measurement. Our system achieves 40 nm lateral and 60 nm axial localization precision with 100 photons and sub-millisecond temporal sampling for real-time tracking. Offline tracking can refine this precision to the microsecond scale. We validated the system’s spatiotemporal resolution by tracking fluorescent beads with diffusion coefficients up to 10 μm2/s. Additionally, we investigated the movement oflysosomes in living SK-N-BE cells andmeasured the fluorescence lifetime of the marker expressed on a membrane protein. We expect that this implementation will open other correlative imaging and tracking studies.</p>
