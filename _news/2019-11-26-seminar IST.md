It is strange to return to your university 15 years later to give a seminar and see some of your old professors in the room. Thank you **Prof. Gaspar Martinho** for the invitation. A day or very useful discussions and hopefully the first meeting of a long standing collaboration on bio-applications of nanoparticles. The work done by **Prof. Carlos Baleizão** and **Prof. Paulo Farinha** on tailored design of nanoparticles is amazing! Looking forward to get our hand in those particles!
